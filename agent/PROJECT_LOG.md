## Milestone: Working AI Agent v1


### What was built:
- Local LLM integration using Ollama (Llama3)
- Python-based agent loop (CLI interface)
- Persistent memory system using JSON storage
- Memory retrieval + scoring system
- Memory overwrite logic for conflicting facts
- Structured prompt injection for context awareness

### Result:
The agent can now:
- Remember user preferences across sessions
- Update facts when corrected
- Retrieve relevant past context dynamically
