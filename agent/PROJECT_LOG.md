## Milestone: Working AI Agent v1


### What was built:
- Local LLM integration using Ollama (Llama3)
- Python-based agent loop (CLI interface)
- Persistent memory system using JSON storage
- Memory retrieval + scoring system
- Memory overwrite logic for conflicting facts
- Structured prompt injection for context awareness

### Result:
The agent can now:
- Remember user preferences across sessions
- Update facts when corrected
- Retrieve relevant past context dynamically

## Milestone: Structured Personal Memory

### What was built
- Added a dedicated `personal_memory.json` for structured user facts.
- Added functions to load and save structured personal memory.
- Added the ability to add and overwrite stored facts.
- Added automatic memory extraction for recognized user information.
- Connected automatic extraction to the main assistant loop.
- Verified that memory persists after the assistant exits.

### Architecture improvement
The assistant now separates structured personal facts from conversation history.

### Example
A statement such as:
"My favorite color is orange"

is extracted and stored as:

{
  "preferences": {
    "favorite_color": "orange"
  }
}

### Result
The assistant can now automatically recognize, update, and persist structured personal information across sessions.

## Milestone: Model Provider Abstraction

### What changed
- Added a dedicated `model_provider.py` module.
- Removed direct Ollama communication from the main assistant logic.
- `llm.py` now sends prompts through the model provider layer.
- Verified that existing structured memory continues to work after the change.

### Architecture improvement
ASTI's assistant logic is no longer directly tied to Ollama.

Current flow:

User → ASTI → Model Provider → Ollama → Local Model

### Why this matters
This creates the foundation for supporting interchangeable AI models and providers without rebuilding the assistant.

ASTI will remain local/private by default, while the architecture can later support optional additional local or cloud providers.


## Milestone: Structured Memory as Source of Truth

### What changed
- Fixed an issue where old conversation history could override current personal facts.
- Updated prompt logic so structured personal memory is authoritative.
- Conversation history is now treated as context only.

### Result
When conversation history conflicts with structured personal memory, ASTI now uses the structured value.

## Milestone: Configurable Model Provider Routing

### What changed
- Added a configurable default provider.
- Added provider-routing logic inside `model_provider.py`.
- Ollama remains the default local provider.
- Unsupported providers now raise a clear error instead of failing silently.

### Architecture improvement
ASTI now routes model requests through a provider layer rather than assuming a single backend.

Current flow:

User → ASTI → Model Provider → Selected Provider → Model

### Result
The assistant continues to work with Ollama while the codebase is now prepared for additional local or optional cloud providers later.

## Milestone: Interchangeable Local Models

### What changed
- Installed Qwen 2.5 3B as a second local model.
- Switched ASTI from Llama 3 to Qwen through `config.py`.
- Fixed the provider configuration import path.
- Verified that ASTI's existing memory and conversation logic worked without modification.

### Architecture improvement
ASTI is no longer dependent on a specific local language model.

Current architecture:

ASTI → Model Provider → Ollama → Selected Local Model

Available tested models:
- Llama 3
- Qwen 2.5 3B

### Result
The underlying model can now be changed through configuration while the assistant, memory system, and application logic remain unchanged.

## Milestone: Generalized Preference Extraction

### What changed
- Expanded personal memory extraction beyond favorite color.
- Added regex-based parsing for statements such as:
  - "my favorite food is pizza"
  - "my favorite movie is Interstellar"
  - "my favorite sport is football"
- Preference names are normalized into structured memory keys.

### Result
ASTI can now automatically store multiple types of user preferences instead of relying on a hardcoded favorite-color rule.

## Milestone: AI-Powered Structured Memory Extraction

### What changed
- Replaced hardcoded memory extraction rules with model-based structured extraction.
- Added a JSON schema for memory decisions.
- Added structured-response support through the model provider layer.
- Qwen now determines whether a user message contains durable personal information.
- Automatically classifies memories into categories such as identity, preferences, goals, projects, people, or other.
- Automatically generates a structured key and value.
- Connected extraction to persistent personal memory storage.

### Example
User statement:
"I prefer aisle seats when I fly"

Extracted memory:
{
  "category": "preferences",
  "key": "preference_for_aisle_seats_when_flying",
  "value": "prefer aisle seats when flying"
}

### Result
ASTI can now learn new types of personal information without requiring a new hardcoded rule for every topic.
